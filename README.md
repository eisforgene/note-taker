## Description:
The Challenge was to create an application that can be used to write and save notes. This application uses Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file. 

## Installation:
* inquirer
* express.js

## Usage: 
After running 'npm init' and 'npm install' in the integrated terminal, you would then run 'npm run start' to start the application. The application will then start listening for the user to enter their localhost.com:3001 from their web browser.
